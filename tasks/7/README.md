# Task 7

## Goal

Define a `ThemeProvider` that provides a `theme` object with a `color` and a `backgroundColor` properties.

## Functionality

The "With(out) theme" button should apply or disable the theme, the "Switch theme" button should switch between the two themes defined in the `themes` array.
